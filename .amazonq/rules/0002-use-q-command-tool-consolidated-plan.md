# Consolidated Implementation Plan for RFC 0002: internal_command_tool

## Implementation Workflow
1. Make incremental changes to one component at a time
2. Before each commit, run the following commands in sequence:
   - `cargo build -p q_cli` to compile and check for build errors
   - `cargo +nightly fmt` to format code according to Rust style guidelines
   - `cargo clippy -p q_cli` to check for code quality issues
   - `cargo test -p q_cli` to ensure all tests pass
3. Commit working changes with detailed commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification
4. After each commit, run `/compact` with the show summary option to maintain clean conversation history
   - Use `/compact` to compact the conversation and show a summary of changes
   - If automatic compaction isn't possible, prompt the user to run `/compact` manually
5. Update the implementation plan to mark completed tasks and identify next steps
6. Repeat the process for the next component or feature

## Overview

The `internal_command` tool enables the AI assistant to directly execute internal commands within the q chat system, improving user experience by handling vague or incorrectly typed requests more gracefully.

## Security Measures

The `internal_command` tool implements several security measures to ensure safe operation:

### 1. Command Validation

All commands are validated before execution to ensure they are recognized internal commands. Unknown commands are rejected with an error message.

### 2. User Acceptance

Command acceptance requirements are based on the nature of the command:
- Read-only commands (like `/help`, `/context show`, `/profile list`) do not require user acceptance
- Mutating/destructive commands (like `/quit`, `/clear`, `/context rm`) require user acceptance before execution

This provides an appropriate security boundary between the AI and command execution while maintaining a smooth user experience for non-destructive operations.

## AI Integration

The tool includes comprehensive AI integration features:

### Enhanced Recognition Patterns

```rust
/// Examples of natural language that should trigger this tool:
/// - "Clear my conversation" -> internal_command with command="clear"
/// - "I want to add a file as context" -> internal_command with command="context", subcommand="add"
/// - "Show me the available profiles" -> internal_command with command="profile", subcommand="list"
/// - "Exit the application" -> internal_command with command="quit"
/// - "Add this file to my context" -> internal_command with command="context", subcommand="add",
///   args=["file.txt"]
/// - "How do I switch profiles?" -> internal_command with command="profile", subcommand="help"
/// - "I need to report a bug" -> internal_command with command="issue"
/// - "Let me trust the file write tool" -> internal_command with command="tools", subcommand="trust",
///   args=["fs_write"]
/// - "Show what tools are available" -> internal_command with command="tools", subcommand="list"
/// - "I want to start fresh" -> internal_command with command="clear"
/// - "Can you help me create a new profile?" -> internal_command with command="profile",
///   subcommand="create"
/// - "I'd like to see what context files I have" -> internal_command with command="context",
///   subcommand="show"
/// - "Remove the second context file" -> internal_command with command="context", subcommand="rm", args=["2"]
/// - "Trust all tools for this session" -> internal_command with command="tools", subcommand="trustall"
/// - "Reset tool permissions to default" -> internal_command with command="tools", subcommand="reset"
/// - "I want to compact the conversation" -> internal_command with command="compact"
/// - "Show me the help for context commands" -> internal_command with command="context", subcommand="help"
```

### Command Parameter Extraction

```rust
/// Optional arguments for the command
///
/// Examples:
/// - For context add: ["file.txt"] - The file to add as context 
///   Example: When user says "add README.md to context", use args=["README.md"]
///   Example: When user says "add these files to context: file1.txt and file2.txt", 
///            use args=["file1.txt", "file2.txt"]
///
/// - For context rm: ["file.txt"] or ["1"] - The file to remove or its index
///   Example: When user says "remove README.md from context", use args=["README.md"]
///   Example: When user says "remove the first context file", use args=["1"]
///
/// - For profile create: ["my-profile"] - The name of the profile to create
///   Example: When user says "create a profile called work", use args=["work"]
///   Example: When user says "make a new profile for my personal projects", use args=["personal"]
```

## Command Migration Strategy

For each command:
1. Document current behavior and implementation
2. Create test cases to verify behavior
3. Implement or update the command handler in the `commands/` directory
4. Update the command execution flow to use the CommandRegistry
5. Test and verify behavior matches before and after
6. Commit changes with detailed documentation

After each command migration:
1. Run the full test suite
2. Document any differences or improvements
3. Update the migration tracking document

No fallback code for transitioned commands:
1. Once a command is migrated, remove the direct implementation
2. Ensure all paths go through the CommandRegistry

### Before/After Comparison Documentation

For each command migration, we will create a detailed comparison document with:

1. **Before Migration**:
   - Original implementation code
   - Behavior description
   - Expected output
   - Special cases

2. **After Migration**:
   - New implementation code
   - Verification of behavior
   - Output comparison
   - Any differences or improvements

3. **Test Results**:
   - Table of test cases
   - Results before and after migration
   - Match status
   - Notes on any discrepancies

- ðŸŸ¢ Completed

## Integration Tests

The integration tests verify that commands executed through the `internal_command` tool behave identically to commands executed directly:

```rust
/// Test context setup for integration tests
struct TestContext {
    /// The context for command execution
    context: Arc<Context>,
    /// A buffer to capture command output
    output_buffer: Vec<u8>,
}

impl TestContext {
    /// Create a new test context
    async fn new() -> Result<Self> {
        let context = ContextBuilder::new()
            .with_test_home()
            .await?
            .build_fake();

        Ok(Self {
            context,
            output_buffer: Vec::new(),
        })
    }

    /// Execute a command directly using the command registry
    async fn execute_direct(&mut self, command: &str) -> Result<ChatState> {
        let registry = CommandRegistry::global();
        registry
            .parse_and_execute(command, &self.context, None, None)
            .await
    }

    /// Execute a command via the internal_command tool
    async fn execute_via_tool(&mut self, command: InternalCommand) -> Result<InvokeOutput> {
        let tool = Tool::InternalCommand(command);
        tool.invoke(&self.context, &mut self.output_buffer).await
    }
}
```

## ChatContext Access Options for Command Handlers

A key challenge in implementing complex commands like `compact`, `profile`, and `context` is providing mutable access to the `ChatContext` for commands called via `InternalCommand`. The following options were considered:

### Option 1: Direct Mutable Reference to ChatContext

**Approach:**
- Modify the `CommandHandler` trait to accept a mutable reference to `ChatContext` directly
- Update the command execution chain to pass this mutable reference

**Implementation:**
```rust
// In commands/handler.rs
pub trait CommandHandler {
    // Update to take mutable reference to ChatContext
    async fn execute(&self, args: Vec<String>, chat_context: &mut ChatContext) -> Result<ChatState>;
    // ...
}

// In commands/registry.rs
impl CommandRegistry {
    pub async fn parse_and_execute(
        &self,
        command: &str,
        chat_context: &mut ChatContext,
        // ...
    ) -> Result<ChatState> {
        // Access context via chat_context.context
        let context = &chat_context.context;
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Pros:**
- Simplest approach - direct and explicit
- No need for additional wrapper types
- Commands have access to both ChatContext and Context

**Cons:**
- Requires refactoring the command execution chain
- May introduce breaking changes to existing code

### Option 2: Interior Mutability with Arc<Mutex<ChatContext>>

**Approach:**
- Wrap `ChatContext` in an `Arc<Mutex<>>` to allow shared mutability
- Pass this wrapped context through the command execution chain

**Implementation:**
```rust
// In chat/mod.rs
pub struct Chat {
    chat_context: Arc<Mutex<ChatContext>>,
    // ...
}

// In commands/handler.rs
pub trait CommandHandler {
    async fn execute(&self, args: Vec<String>, chat_context: Arc<Mutex<ChatContext>>) -> Result<ChatState>;
    // ...
}
```

**Pros:**
- Minimal changes to function signatures
- Allows shared access to mutable state
- Thread-safe approach

**Cons:**
- Risk of deadlocks if not managed carefully
- More complex error handling around lock acquisition
- Performance overhead from locking

### Option 3: Command Result with Mutation Instructions

**Approach:**
- Commands return a `CommandResult` that includes both the `ChatState` and a set of mutation instructions
- The chat loop applies these mutations to the `ChatContext`

**Implementation:**
```rust
// Define mutation instructions
pub enum ChatContextMutation {
    AddMessage(Message),
    SetProfile(Profile),
    AddContext(ContextFile),
    RemoveContext(usize),
    ClearContext,
    // ...
}

// Command result with mutations
pub struct CommandResult {
    pub state: ChatState,
    pub mutations: Vec<ChatContextMutation>,
}

// Updated CommandHandler trait
pub trait CommandHandler {
    // Pass immutable reference to ChatContext for read access
    async fn execute(&self, args: Vec<String>, chat_context: &ChatContext) -> Result<CommandResult>;
    // ...
}
```

**Pros:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Commands don't need direct mutable access
- Explicit about what changes are being made

**Cons:**
- More verbose for commands that need to make multiple changes
- Requires defining all possible mutations upfront

### Option 4: Callback-Based Approach

**Approach:**
- Define a set of callback functions that modify the `ChatContext`
- Pass these callbacks to the command handlers

**Implementation:**
```rust
// Define a callback type that takes mutable ChatContext
type ChatContextCallback = Box<dyn FnOnce(&mut ChatContext) -> Result<()> + Send>;

// In the command execution flow
pub async fn execute_command(
    command: &str, 
    chat_context: &ChatContext,
    mutation_callback: ChatContextCallback
) -> Result<ChatState> {
    // Execute command with read-only access to chat_context
    let state = registry.parse_and_execute(command, chat_context).await?;
    
    // Apply mutations if needed
    mutation_callback(chat_context)?;
    
    Ok(state)
}
```

**Pros:**
- Flexible and extensible
- Avoids direct mutable references
- Can be implemented incrementally

**Cons:**
- Complex to implement and use
- Error handling is more challenging
- May lead to callback hell

### Selected Approach: Option 1 - Direct Mutable Reference to ChatContext

We've selected Option 1 (Direct Mutable Reference to ChatContext) for these reasons:

1. It's the simplest approach with minimal abstraction overhead
2. It provides direct access to both `ChatContext` and `Context` (via `chat_context.context`)
3. It follows Rust's ownership rules clearly
4. It's a straightforward refactoring that can be implemented incrementally

#### Implementation Plan:

1. Update the `CommandHandler` trait to accept a mutable reference to `ChatContext`
2. Modify the `CommandRegistry::parse_and_execute` method to accept a mutable reference to `ChatContext`
3. Update the `InternalCommand` tool to pass the mutable `ChatContext`
4. Migrate commands one by one to use the new signature

## Current and Next Steps

### Current Step: Begin Phase 6.3: Migrate Complex Commands with Existing Handlers

1. **Start with the `context` command and its subcommands**:
   - Migrate each subcommand individually
   - Ensure proper argument parsing
   - Implement whitespace handling for file paths using shlex
   - Verify file operations work correctly
   - Run the following commands before committing:
     ```
     cargo build -p q_cli
     cargo +nightly fmt
     cargo clippy -p q_cli
     cargo test -p q_cli
     ```
   - Commit changes with a descriptive message following Conventional Commits format
   - Run `/compact` with show summary option after the commit (or prompt user to do so manually)
   - Update the implementation plan to mark this task as completed

### Next Steps:

1. **Continue Phase 6.3: Migrate Complex Commands with Existing Handlers**
   - After `context` command, move on to the `profile` command and its subcommands
   - Ensure profile management works correctly
   - Verify error handling
   - Follow the same pre-commit and post-commit process

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in command-related errors
- Increase in successful command executions
- Positive user feedback on the natural language command interface
- Reduction in the number of steps required to complete common tasks
- Consistent behavior between direct command execution and tool-based execution
- 100% test coverage for AI command interpretation across all commands
- Simplified and maintainable architecture after Phase 7 refinement

## Risks and Mitigations

### Security Risks

**Risk**: Allowing the AI to execute commands directly could introduce security vulnerabilities.
**Mitigation**: Implement strict validation, require user confirmation for all commands, and limit the scope of commands that can be executed.

### User Confusion

**Risk**: Users might not understand what actions the AI is taking on their behalf.
**Mitigation**: Provide clear feedback about what commands are being executed and why.

### Implementation Complexity

**Risk**: The feature requires careful integration with the existing command infrastructure.
**Mitigation**: Use a phased approach, starting with a minimal viable implementation and adding features incrementally.

### Maintenance Burden

**Risk**: As new commands are added to the system, the `internal_command` tool will need to be updated.
**Mitigation**: Design the command registry to be extensible, allowing new commands to be added without modifying the `internal_command` tool.
